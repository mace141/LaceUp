# LaceUp

LaceUp is a place where users can connect with people who want to play sports together. Users may find other players of the same skill level to play against for just the right amount of challenge. They may create events, either games or tournaments, for others to attend. Tournament brackets will be seeded by us based on the player's/team’s skill level and the prizes will be automatically distributed to the winner’s accounts. Users may also find their own community by creating a club. 

LaceUp is built upon a MongoDB database, Express web application framework, React-Redux frontend, and Node.js backend.
