# LaceUp

LaceUp is a place where users can connect with people who want to play sports together. Users can find other players of the same skill level to play against for just the right amount of challenge. Users can create events, or join already existing events specific by park and event type. When joining an event, users are able to see the number of teams required for the event, and with the click of one button, lace up for their team of choice!

They may create events, either games or tournaments, for others to attend. Tournament brackets will be seeded by us based on the player's/team’s skill level and the prizes will be automatically distributed to the winner’s accounts. Users may also find their own community by creating a club.
